# Foundation Model lightweight fine-tuning
## Overview
Application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library

## Project goals
* Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
* Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
* Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
